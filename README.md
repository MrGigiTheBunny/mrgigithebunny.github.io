I am redesigning the website (again), the old design will be live until I am finished the new redesign fully. https://mrgigi.me/

Wednesday 30 September: Pushed a huge update:

- Rebuild the website from the ground up
- Made the code more "beautiful", less cluttered, deleted code that wasn't being used
- Implemented the Boostrap library
- Implemented the jQuery library
- Added support for devices with different pixel sizes, screen ratio (so it looks good on mobile now)
- Now when you link this website in example twitter, discord, whatsapp, etc. It properly shows the context card
- Faster load times
- Images are now optimized
- And more! (I forgot)
